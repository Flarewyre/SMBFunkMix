	This is the chartloader class. it loads in charts, but also exports charts, the chart parameters are based on the type of chart, 
	say the base game type loads the base game's charts, the forever chart type loads a custom forever structure chart with custom features,
	and so on. This class will handle both saving and loading of charts with useful features and scripts that will make things much easier
	to handle and load, as well as much more modular!
